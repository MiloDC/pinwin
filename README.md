# PinWin
A fork off [Victor Zakharov's .NET implementation](https://github.com/VictorZakharov/pinwin) of the original [DeskPins](http://efotinis.neocities.org/deskpins/index.html) Windows application, written by [Elias Fotinis](http://efotinis.neocities.org/about.html).

I'm planning to turn this into an F# application.  In the meantime, I've made an aesthetic change to the pushpin graphic.

Victor takes care that PinWin works all the way back to Windows XP.  I develop on Windows 11, and I don't care whether it works on anything older than that.

### Credits
Thanks, Victor.  Nice to have a .NET version of a great utility that many of us have been using for years.
